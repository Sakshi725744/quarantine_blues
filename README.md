Quarantine Blues

One stop remedy to the tide away the blues you may be facing. Quarantine Blues is an app that emphasises that you are not alone during this pandemic and now anything and everything you may need from hacks, to home remedies is now just a click of a button away.

We have made our own acrostic on the word ‘Blues’ to put emphasis on body and mind, love, updates and changes, enhancing skills and a support kit.

The logo is a culmination of our thought process, designed to show the letter Q, with cool colours portraying the blues. It can be viewed as hand lifting up the Earth to show that we are all in this together as a global community.

We have used Flutter and Android XD to make this app. 
 
We had to implement a media player, any RESTful api of our choice and push notifications using FCM.
